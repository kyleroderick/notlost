    <p class="post-body"><p>Computers are able to read a person&rsquo;s body language to tell whether they are bored or interested in what they see on the screen. The research shows that by measuring a person&rsquo;s movements as they use a computer, it is possible to judge their level of interest by monitoring whether they display the tiny movements that people usually constantly exhibit, known as non-instrumental movements.</p>

    <p class="post-body"><p>Conservatives prefer using nouns, new transatlantic research suggests. The research also established that conservatives generally, to a greater degree than liberals, tend to refer to things by their names, rather than describing them in terms of their features. An example would be saying someone &lsquo;is an optimist&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;is optimistic&rsquo;.</p>

    <p class="post-body"><p>FRBs or “fast radio bursts” are extremely energetic pulses that only last for a few milliseconds. They’ve only been observed 17 times from random points in the sky. Now, a report in <strong>Nature</strong>  shows that astronomers have been able to pinpoint the location of one that released two days worth of our Sun’s energy in a fraction of a second.</p>

    <p class="post-body"><p>Gorillas sing and hum when eating, a discovery that could help shed light on how language evolved in early humans. Singing seems to be a way for gorillas to express contentment with their meal, as well as for the head of the family to communicate to others that it is dinner time.</p>
